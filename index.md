# About us

Portsmouth Joggers is a friendly and inclusive club.  We have over 200 runners and joggers of all abilities â€” from _absolute beginners_ to _ultra marathon_ runners.

On club nights we split into [groups](/groups) of different abilities, so whatever your running experience we'll have a group for you to run comfortably with - so - **come along!**

We meet at 7pm every Tuesday & Thursday, in the main entrance hall of [Lakeside 1000 North Harbour](https://www.google.com/maps/@50.8410345,-1.0823719,3a,75y,231.82h,91.78t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sLSmv-zPgQbje3Z_ZDfg_HQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DLSmv-zPgQbje3Z_ZDfg_HQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D212.92085%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
