# Join us!

We welcome new members at any time of year.  Just come along to any clib night, say the magic words _"Hello, I'm new"_ and you'll get a warm welcome as we find you a suitable group to start off with.

You can try a few sessions before becoming a member and we're sure that you will enjoy the experience!
