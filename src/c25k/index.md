# Couch to 5K

## What is Couch to 5K?
Couch to 5K is a running plan for absolute beginners. The concept was originally developed by a new runner, Josh Clark, who wanted to help his 50-something mum get off the couch and start running too.  The plan covers nine weeks, with three runs each week.  There's a rest day between each run, and a varied plan for each of the 9 weeks - starting and progressing gently.

## How does Couch to 5K work?
Probably the biggest challenge a new runner faces is not knowing how or where to start.  Often when trying to get into exercise, we can overdo it, feel defeated and give up when we're just getting started.  Couch to 5K works because it starts with a mix of running and walking to gradually build up your fitness and stamina.  Week 1 involves running for just a minute at a time, creating realistic expectations and making the challenge feel achievable right from the start.

## Who is Couch to 5K for?
Couch to 5K is for everyone. Whether you've never run before or you just want to get more active, Couch to 5K is a free and easy way of getting fitter and healthier.  If you have any health concerns about beginning an exercise regime like Couch to 5K, make an appointment to see a GP and discuss it with them first.

## When does it start?
